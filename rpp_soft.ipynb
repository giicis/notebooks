    "# Release planning problem with soft constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [previous blog post]() we have seen how a rpp model can help us when planning releases for a project. But, it turns out that the model can be a little bit to strict when deciding if we should implement a requirement or not.The previous model have assummed that the cost of each requirement is well know and it will not vary during the implementation. In the software engineering world we know that this is not true. Most of the time, we give an aproximation of the cost and if we are good enough the aproximation is close enough.\n",
    "In this post, we provide a model that can deal with this problem using fuzzy logic."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "This model has shown that using fuzzy logic is not as hard as it seems and it can provide a good way of modelling uncertanty. Furthermore, we only have used it in one constraint, but it ca be used in almost every way you can imagine.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next posts, we'll see that this comes with a downside. Using fuzzy logic increase the computational resources requiered to solve the problem and using an algorithm may not be the best option; so we'll need another method to find a solution."
